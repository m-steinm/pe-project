# Form Interface Testing





## Craig

### site-wide

1. Could you find them? Was it difficult? Easy? 
- Easy. right at the top of the projects page, grouped together visually. If there are other projects there it might change?


2. Was it at user/projects/e4p?
- yep


3. How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? Are the links clear?
- If I didn't know what exercises for programmers was, a subheading with a quick explanation might make it extra clear. Links are pretty clearly links


### per form

1. Does it match the rest of the site? 
- character counts does, pizza party and tax calc match eachother. 


2. How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do? (imagine a grandparent is trying to use it)d
- Tax calculator and pizza party are the clearest. Math calculator isn't totally clear until you submit the two numbers. 


3. Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?
- yes. especially the button on character counts


4. Does the form work with the expected input?
- yes

5. Can you break it by putting in other values like 0 and empty?
- Tax calculator probably shouldn't go negative under order amount. It doesn't work for lower case "wi"


6. Do things jump around when you interact with them?
- the text box under character counts is adjustable

7. Is the outcome clear?
- yes

8. Do the form styles match across all forms?
- not yet

9. Is it a pleasure to use?
- i laughed at the pizza jokes

10. What could be improved?
- some of the spacing across the forms, and style consitancy, whether thats to match the site like character counter or eachother like the pizza party and tax calculator

### per form - retirement calculator

1. Does it match the rest of the site? 
- they each have their own unique style

2. How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do? (imagine a grandparent is trying to use it)d
- the retirement calculator is pretty clear in its purpose, and the font choice invites the user to come up with a little story about retirement

- yes

- yes

10. What could be improved?
- colors that are a little easier on the eyes. the text input doesnt need to be so long and narrow?
