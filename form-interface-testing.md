# Form Interface Testing





## Craig

### site-wide

1. Could you find them? Was it difficult? Easy? 
- Easy. right at the top of the projects page, grouped together visually. If there are other projects there it might change?


2. Was it at user/projects/e4p?
- yep


3. How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? Are the links clear?
- If I didn't know what exercises for programmers was, a subheading with a quick explanation might make it extra clear. Links are pretty clearly links


### per form

1. Does it match the rest of the site? 
- character counts does, pizza party and tax calc match eachother. 


2. How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do? (imagine a grandparent is trying to use it)d
- Tax calculator and pizza party are the clearest. Math calculator isn't totally clear until you submit the two numbers. 


3. Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?
- yes. especially the button on character counts


4. Does the form work with the expected input?
- yes

5. Can you break it by putting in other values like 0 and empty?
- Tax calculator probably shouldn't go negative under order amount. It doesn't work for lower case "wi"


6. Do things jump around when you interact with them?
- the text box under character counts is adjustable

7. Is the outcome clear?
- yes

8. Do the form styles match across all forms?
- not yet

9. Is it a pleasure to use?
- i laughed at the pizza jokes

10. What could be improved?
- some of the spacing across the forms, and style consitancy, whether thats to match the site like character counter or eachother like the pizza party and tax calculator

### site-wide

1. Could you find them? Was it difficult? Easy?

2. Was it at user/projects/e4p?


3. How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? Are the links clear?


### per form - retirement calculator

1. Does it match the rest of the site? 
- they each have their own unique style

2. How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do? (imagine a grandparent is trying to use it)d
- the retirement calculator is pretty clear in its purpose, and the font choice invites the user to come up with a little story about retirement

3. Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?
- yes

4. Does the form work with the expected input?
- yes

5. Can you break it by putting in other values like 0 and empty?
- no

6. Do things jump around when you interact with them?
- no

7. Is the outcome clear?
- yes

8. Do the form styles match across all forms?

9. Is it a pleasure to use?
- can't retire in the past is funny. the colors are a little intense and hard to look at for too long maybe

10. What could be improved?
- colors that are a little easier on the eyes. the text input doesnt need to be so long and narrow?

### site-wide

1. Could you find them? Was it difficult? Easy? 
  - Pretty easy. Code is right on the homepage, but "code" could maybe be more specific

2. Was it at user/projects/e4p?
- slightly different, spelling out exercises-for-programmers


3. How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? Are the links clear?
- explains very clearly what the excercises are and what book they come from

### per form - Character Counter

1. Does it match the rest of the site? 
- Yeah, it's nice

2. How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do? (imagine a grandparent is trying to use it)
- if I didn't know what a string was it might be a little confusing


3. Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels? 
- yes. "your string" could use a little space from the count button so it's more clearly attached to the text box


4. Does the form work with the expected input?
- yes

5. Can you break it by putting in other values like 0 and empty?
- no

6. Do things jump around when you interact with them?
- the box can be adjusted by the user, without any real reason for that to be an option it might be better if it was one size.

7. Is the outcome clear?
- yes

8. Do the form styles match across all forms?
- yes

9. Is it a pleasure to use?
- yes

10. What could be improved?
- some of the spacing.

## Hunter

### site-wide

1. Could you find them? Was it difficult? Easy?
- a little dificult becuase the links on the index point towards "localhost" not the pe server.

2. Was it at user/projects/e4p?
- yes, after I figured out how to put in the file path manually


3. How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? Are the links clear?
- it is clear, but could use and explanation of what the excercises are.

### per form - Character Counter

1. Does it match the rest of the site? 
- similar. they are all clear and match eachother.

2. How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do? (imagine a grandparent is trying to use it)
- I think they could use a little more explanation.

3. Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels? 
- yes, it all looks good.

4. Does the form work with the expected input?
- some of them, like the simple math form allow letters as well as numbers

5. Can you break it by putting in other values like 0 and empty?
- yes, in the retirement form for example, it still gives an answer even if the input is a letter.

6. Do things jump around when you interact with them?
- no

7. Is the outcome clear?
- I think so

8. Do the form styles match across all forms?
- yes

9. Is it a pleasure to use?
- yes, it's clear and I especially like the gray block that the results are displayed in

10. What could be improved?
- some of the descriptions and contstraints.
