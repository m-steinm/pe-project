## Atlas Coffee

- sticky header
- light cream colors w/ dark header and footer
- sans serif
- shows how coffee is from all over teh world

## Trade
- same kind of main image on top, but with videos
- images of coffee farms and farmers
- all sans serif - bold for headings - thin for text

## Misto Box
- more sanitized
- cream an light white

## Craft Coffee
- cheapest subscription/ least polished webiste
- log in button looks like it's cut off on the top?

## Verve
- main image is large and split with flat color. not quite a full background image
- more of a pastel/ muted pallete.
- sans serif all around, but headings look like a handwritten font. not quite perfect. gives it a little more character. 
- logo is centered in header and footer, creates just enough of a difference from all of the other sites to be noticable. 
- logo is serif

## Yes Plz
- bright/ flat colors
- bold serif fonts for headings

## Inteligentisa
- topographic lines in the background - "travel"




### things I'll use

- thin type in header
-  all caps
- lots of thin lines all around
- two color headers

## font pair
- selected from list of google font pairings
- goudy for headers
- average sans for body text
- not all of the sites i looked at had serif fonts for headers, but about half did. adds a little bit of a higher end look, less like a sleek website. more like it's rooted in the real world. coffee for people that would use typewriters if they could
- body text, still clean and easy to read. it is a sleek website for a coffee delivery compnay after all.

## colors

- borrowed some colors. lighter and darker shades of cream. clean and make me think of a latte
- pastel red and bright red for accents
- slate and slightly darker blue for nice coffee shop vibe
- they all have a dark color header or footer to differentiate from the rest of the page
